# Disease_Prediction_ML_WebApp
A web app built with Python, Streamlit that is based on Machine Learning.

# How it works :
The user inserts the required data and then presses on the 'test result' button,
then the app return an output of the result that the ML model predicted (diseased or not).

# Link for the app :
https://mohamedabedrabo-disease-prediction-ml-webapp-mdps-public-95nldx.streamlitapp.com

# Data to test the app :
Diabetes : 10,125,70,26,115,31.1,0.205,41. it should return that the person is diseased.
Heart disease : 54,1,0,110,239,0,1,126,1,2.8,1,1,3. it should return that the person is not diseased

# What I did :
I used the attached datasets to train the models : diabetes.csv, heart_disease_data.csv .

1st : I built the models with Python Jupyter Notebook using Logistic Regression and SVM algorithms.
Files : Diabetes_Prediction_SVM.py, Heart_Disease_Prediction_LR.py .

2nd : I built the User Interface with Python Spyder tool and then i deployed the app using streamlit.
File : mdps_public.py .

Every thing is well explaned with notes inside each code files.
